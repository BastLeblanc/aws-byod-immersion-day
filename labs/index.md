# Data Engineering #

Welcome fellow analytics enthusiast. This is a support web-page for instructor
led Labs around AWS data platform services.

As of now we cover a few Data Engineering use-cases, such as hydrating the
datalake, orchestration with Glue, data visualization and governance.

This workshop is designed to be followed using your own dataset, during the lab we use some examples of the NYC taxis dataset.
